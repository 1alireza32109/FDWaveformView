FDWaveformView
==============

Reads an audio file and displays the waveform.

Features:

  * You set the URL, I figure it out from there
  * You can show play progress
  * Supports animation
  * If I'm stretched, I will redraw to avoid pixelation
  * Supports iOS5+ and ARC
  * If allowed, touching me can set progress to that point
